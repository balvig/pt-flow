## Installation

Install the gem:

Set up webhook for Pivotal Tracker:

    https://github.com/#{repo}/admin/hooks

### Basic Usage

```bash
$ git start
# shows lists of tasks (excluding icebox) - choosing one starts/assigns the task on pt and
# automatically creates and checks out a new branch.

$ git start --include-icebox
# same as git start, including contents of icebox

$ git finish
# pushes branch, finishes task on pt, and creates a pull request
# reviewer comments :+1: to approve on github
# committer presses merge button on github which delivers task on pivotal tracker

$ git finish --draft
# Opens github pull request screen rather than auto-submitting

$ git cleanup
# cleans up local/remote story branches already merged with current release branch
```
